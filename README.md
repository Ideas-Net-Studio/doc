# Proposal: Jira XRay Integration for Automated Playwright BDD Tests

## Objective

This proposal aims to establish an integration between Jira XRay and our Playwright BDD test framework. The primary goal is to enable Product Owners (POs), Governance teams, and non-developer stakeholders to directly author and maintain Gherkin scenarios inside Jira XRay tickets. These scenarios will then be automatically synchronized and executed as Playwright automated tests.

## Motivation

- **Governance & Transparency**: Scenarios live inside Jira, the single source of truth, making it easier for governance teams to review and audit test coverage.

- **Collaboration**: Non-developers (POs, QA analysts, business stakeholders) can contribute by writing or updating Gherkin scenarios without editing code repositories.

- **Reusability**: We already maintain a comprehensive set of reusable fixtures that cover common UI patterns:

  - Click actions

  - Element visibility assertions

  - Form field validation

  - Navigation and URL checks

  - Error message handling

  - more...

- **Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for developers to constantly regenerate `.feature` files manually. Instead, scenarios are written once in Jira and automatically pulled into the automation pipeline.

## Proposed Solution

1. **XRay → Playwright Pipeline**

    - Use the XRay REST API to fetch scenarios from Jira tickets.

    - Store them as cached `.feature` files in the test repository.

    - Only regenerate `.feature` files when the Jira ticket has been updated, ensuring efficiency.

2. **Execution Flow**

    - Product Owners and Governance write/update Gherkin scenarios in Jira XRay.

    - The automation pipeline (CI/CD) fetches updated scenarios before running tests.

    - Playwright executes the scenarios using existing reusable fixtures.

3. **Caching Mechanism**

    - Each ticket’s updated timestamp will be compared with the locally cached `.feature` file.

    - Only scenarios `updated` since the last run will be re-generated.

    - **Resilience / Fallback**: If Jira or XRay APIs are unreachable, respond with a non-fatal warning and use the last cached `.feature` files so the test suite still runs. No cache rewrite occurs when offline; normal sync resumes on the next successful run.

## Benefits

- **For Governance**: Centralized access to test scripts in Jira. Easier audits and compliance validation.

- **For Product Owners**: Ability to directly define acceptance criteria as executable tests.

- **For Developers**: Reduced maintenance effort, since reusable fixtures abstract away common test steps.

- **For Dev Automation Teams**: Streamlined workflow, as feature files are automatically kept in sync.

## Requirements

1. API Access

    - Jira REST API credentials (user email + API token).

    - XRay API credentials:

      - Cloud: Client ID and Client Secret.

      - Server/DC: Jira username + API token or password.

2. Permissions

    - Read access to Jira issues containing test scenarios.

    - Export permission from XRay.

3. Security Considerations

    - Credentials will be stored securely (TBD).

    - Access will be limited to read-only operations.

## Request for Approval

We request approval from leadership and IT administration to:

1. Generate and provide the necessary Jira API token and XRay API credentials.

2. Permit integration of this workflow into our CI/CD pipeline.

3. Enable non-developer teams to take ownership of Gherkin scenario authoring directly within Jira.

## Conclusion

By adopting this integration, we empower Governance, Product Owners, and non-developer contributors to actively participate in defining test coverage. With reusable fixtures already in place, this approach significantly enhances collaboration, transparency, and efficiency while reducing developer overhead.

**Next Step**: Approval to obtain Jira and XRay API keys/secrets for implementation.
